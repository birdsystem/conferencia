This is a WebRTC Conferece Script for owncloud 

#Problems
i have a Content-security Policy error, I'm trying to run scripts from another domain and the console returns me the following error:
"Refused to frame 'https://cdn.webrtc-experiment.com/getIceServers/' because it violates the Following Content Security Policy directive:" default-src 'none' "Note that 'frame-src' was not Explicitly set. , so 'default-src' is used as a fallback. "
